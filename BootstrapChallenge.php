		<h1>It's LeviOsa not LevioSA</h1>
		<p>
			The wand chooses the wizard You sort of start thinking anythings possible if youve got enough nerve There are
			all kinds of courage I think Ill just go and have some pudding Its wingardium leviOsa not leviosAH Give her
			hell from us Peeves There are some things you cant share without ending up liking each other and knocking out
			a twelvefoot mountain troll is one of them But you know happiness can be found even in the darkest of times if
			one only remembers to turn on the light. It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies but just
			as much to stand up to our friends I think Ill just go and have some pudding But you know happiness can be
			found even in the darkest of times if one only remembers to turn on the light It is our choices Harry that
			show what we truly are far more than our abilities, It is our choices Harry that show what we truly are far
			more than our abilities She needs to sort out her priorities Yer a wizard Harry Just because you have the
			emotional range of a teaspoon doesnt mean we all have Now Im going to bed before either of you comes up with
			another clever idea to get us killed Or worse expelled There are all kinds of courage Until the very end. Not
			my daughter you bitch It is the unknown we fear when we look upon death and darkness nothing more After all
			this time But you know happiness can be found even in the darkest of times if one only remembers to turn on
			the light But you know happiness can be found even in the darkest of times if one only remembers to turn on
			the light After all this time Its wingardium leviOsa not leviosAH Really Hagrid if you are holding out for
			universal popularity Im afraid you will be in this cabin for a very long time There are some things you cant
			share without ending up liking each other and knocking out a twelvefoot mountain troll is one of them.
